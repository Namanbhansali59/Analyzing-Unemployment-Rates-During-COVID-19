# Unemployment Rate Analysis During COVID-19

## Project Overview

This project involves analyzing unemployment rates during the COVID-19 pandemic. The goal is to understand the trends and forecast future unemployment rates using time series analysis. The project includes data cleaning, visualization, and ARIMA modeling.

## Key Highlights

- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Handled missing values and formatted date columns.
- **Data Visualization**: Created visualizations to depict unemployment rate trends over time.
- **Time Series Analysis**: Applied the ARIMA model to forecast unemployment rates.

## Tools and Libraries

- **Python**: The primary programming language used.
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas`: For data manipulation and cleaning.
  - `matplotlib`: For creating visualizations.
  - `seaborn`: For advanced data visualization.
  - `statsmodels`: For time series modeling and forecasting.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes columns such as:
- `Region`: The geographical region.
- `Date`: The date of the record.
- `Frequency`: The frequency of the data (e.g., monthly).
- `Estimated Unemployment Rate (%)`: The estimated unemployment rate.
- `Estimated Employed`: The number of employed individuals.
- `Estimated Labour Participation Rate (%)`: The labor participation rate.
- `Area`: The area of the region.

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/unemployment-rate-analysis.git
   cd unemployment-rate-analysis
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Make sure you have Python installed. Install the required libraries using pip:

   ```sh
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn statsmodels
   ```

3. **Download the Dataset**

   Ensure that you have the dataset CSV file available. Update the file path in the script to point to your dataset.

## Running the Analysis

1. **Load and Prepare Data**

   Make sure to update the `url` variable in the script with the path to your dataset.

2. **Run the Analysis**

   Execute the Python script to perform the analysis:

   ```sh
   python unemployment_analysis.py
   ```

3. **View Results**

   The script will generate plots and forecasts that visualize the unemployment trends and predictions.
